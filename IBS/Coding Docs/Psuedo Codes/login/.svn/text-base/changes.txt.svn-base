//Changes for ajay bhaiyya in these modules
	1. Firstly should not DatabaseConnection be a different module to open, close and handle connection.
	2. There should be a function in DatabaseConnection closeConnection(string URL) which will close connection properly
	3. Class name and file name should be same, so rename DBConn.java to DatabaseConnection.java
	4. In file DBConn.java getDatabaseConnection should return conn.
	5. In DatabaseConnection should connection variable need to be public.
	6. For security reasons we will save encrypted password in our database, So in Login.java class first encrypt the password and then check into the database
	7. So it will be easier to make a new module to encrypt and decrypt password using some algorithm
